Coffees from this region have rocked the specialty world over the last several years, producing some of the world's most complex profiles. Located right next to the equally impressive site of Hamasho, Keramo sits at an altitude of 2,360 masl, which helps produce higher-density seeds with a heavy concentration of smaller screen sizes—an indicator of the slower maturation times that occur at extreme altitudes.</p><h2><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->ABOUT ETHIOPIAN LANDRACE</h2><p>Ethiopia is widely acknowledged as where coffee originated, and its production continues to represent about 10% of the country’s gross domestic product. DNA testing has confirmed over 60 distinct varieties growing in Ethiopia, making it home to the most coffee biodiversity of any region in the world. Given the tradition of coffee production in Ethiopia and the political interworkings of the Ethiopian coffee trade, it is virtually impossible to get single variety coffee lots from Ethiopia. This is changing, albeit very slowly. Most Ethiopian coffees are blends of the many Ethiopian varieties, and referred to simply as 'Ethiopian Landrace'.<span id="isPasted" style='color: rgb(31, 31, 31); font-family: "Google Sans", Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;'></span><span id="isPasted" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(0, 255, 0); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"></span><span data-sheets-userformat='{"2":899,"3":{"1":0},"4":{"1":2,"2":65280},"10":1,"11":4,"12":0}' data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;ABOUT ETHIOPIAN LANDRACE\nEthiopia is widely acknowledged as where coffee originated, and its production continues to represent about 10% of the country’s gross domestic product.

<p>The cost of getting a coffee from cherry to beverage varies enormously depending on its place of origin and the location of its consumption. The inclusion of price transparency is a starting point to inform broader conversation around the true costs of production and the sustainability of specialty coffee as a whole.</p>
