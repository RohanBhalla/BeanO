<h2>ABOUT ELIDA GREEN TIP GESHA</h2><p>Four generations of the Lamastus Family have been producing coffee since 1918. Rising from 1,700 to 2,060 masl, and nestled within the Volcan Baru National Forest Reserve—a native, old-growth cloud forest—the farm has excellent shade coverage, biodiversity, and rich volcanic soil full of beneficial microorganisms. All of this helps to produce some of the most complex coffee cherries ever tasted. At such high altitude, Elida’s microclimate is quite cold, greatly lengthening the time of cherry maturation, which is very important for the development of sugars and acidities in the cup. This particular coffee won back-to-back Best of Panama Washed competitions in both 2018 and 2019.</p><h2>ABOUT GESHA</h2><p>Gesha was originally collected from coffee forests of Ethiopia in the 1930's. From there, it was sent to the Lyamungo Research Station in Tanzania, and then brought to Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza (CATIE) in Central America in the 1953, where it was logged as accession T2722. It was distributed throughout Panama via CATIE in the 1960’s after its tolerance to coffee leaf rust was recognized. However, it was not widely planted because the plant's branches were brittle and not favored by farmers. Gesha came to prominence in 2005, when the Peterson family of Boquete, Panama, entered it into the Best of Panama competition and auction. It received exceptionally high marks and broke the then-record for green coffee auction prices, selling for over $20 per pound. Since then, the variety has become a resounding favorite of brewing and roasting competition winners and coffee enthusiasts alike.<span data-sheets-userformat='{"2":11139,"3":{"1":0},"4":[null,2,65280],"10":1,"11":4,"12":0,"14":[null,2,0],"16":10}' data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"ABOUT ELIDA GREEN TIP GESHA\nFour generations of the Lamastus Family have been producing coffee since 1918.

<p>The cost of getting a coffee from cherry to beverage varies enormously depending on its place of origin and the location of its consumption. The inclusion of price transparency is a starting point to inform broader conversation around the true costs of production and the sustainability of specialty coffee as a whole.</p>
