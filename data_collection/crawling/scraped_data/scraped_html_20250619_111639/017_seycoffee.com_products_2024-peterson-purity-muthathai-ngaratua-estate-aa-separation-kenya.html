She was traveling with Alejandro Renjifo and his exporting company Fairfield Trading in order to share insights and techniques to producers in the region. She is highly ambitious, and is constantly learning and improving year after year. Her main goals are to continue improving the quality of her coffee while minimizing negative environmental impact. She is especially interested in sustainable farming practices using little or no chemical inputs, and improving soil health through the planting of native plants and trees. She has also started teaching her neighboring producers how to improve their quality and avail themselves to the specialty market. Her contribution to specialty coffee within the region of Gaitania cannot be overstated, and it is a true honor to work with her coffee."}' style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;color:#000000;"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Roboto, RobotoDraft, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Roboto, RobotoDraft, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Roboto, RobotoDraft, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Roboto, RobotoDraft, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"></span>ABOUT PETERSON &amp; PURITY MUTHATHAI </h2><p>Ngarutua Estate was established in the 1940’s, when Kenya was still part of the British Empire. It was named after its founder: Paul Muthathai Ngarutua. The first coffee was planted in 1958, when it became legal for Africans to plant coffee; however, the ten-acre farm was legally limited to a maximum of 100 trees. That rule was lifted around 1960, and more trees were planted in the 60’s and early 70’s. The farm was passed on to Paul’s wife, Dina Mukami Muthahai, who then passed it on to her son Peterson and his wife Purity. After university, Peterson—now the current Director of The Kenya Planters Cooperative Union representing the Mount Kenya region—and his wife fully took on the farm operations. They have invested heavily in the planting of more SL28 trees, and are currently saving to build better drying tables. They are highly motivated producers, and it is an honor to roast their coffee.</p><h2><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->ABOUT SL28</h2><p>“SL” is in reference to single tree selections made by Scott Agricultural Laboratories in 1935-1939. SL28 is of the Bourbon genetic group, and was selected for its drought resistance as well as its extremely high cup quality. SL28 is one of the most well-known and well-regarded varieties in Africa. It has consequently spread from Kenya to other parts of Africa as well as Central and South America. SL28 is non-hybrid, and very susceptible to disease.<span id="isPasted" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(0, 255, 0); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"></span><br/></p>
