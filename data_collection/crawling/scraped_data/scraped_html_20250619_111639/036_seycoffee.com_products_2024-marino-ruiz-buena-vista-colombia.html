She was traveling with Alejandro Renjifo and his exporting company Fairfield Trading in order to share insights and techniques to producers in the region. She is highly ambitious, and is constantly learning and improving year after year. Her main goals are to continue improving the quality of her coffee while minimizing negative environmental impact. She is especially interested in sustainable farming practices using little or no chemical inputs, and improving soil health through the planting of native plants and trees. She has also started teaching her neighboring producers how to improve their quality and avail themselves to the specialty market. Her contribution to specialty coffee within the region of Gaitania cannot be overstated, and it is a true honor to work with her coffee."}' style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;color:#000000;"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Roboto, RobotoDraft, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"></span><span id="isPasted" style='color: rgb(31, 31, 31); font-family: "Google Sans", Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;'></span>ABOUT MARINO RUIZ</h2><p>Marino Ruiz is one of the first producers we've met through a new project we just started in southern Huila. The project aims to increase the quality of coffee coming from this region by incentivizing producers with premiums for higher-quality coffees. We've been captivated by this place and the mystery behind the origins of Pink Bourbon, and are motivated by how much is yet to be learned and improved upon in this region. As this project continues, we expect to shed more and more light on these mysteries and why Huila has been so important in the development of specialty coffee. </p><h2>ABOUT PINK BOURBON</h2><p>Pink Bourbon is a relatively new variety being grown primarily in and around Huila, Colombia. The variety has been identified genetically as an Ethiopian Landrace, but unfortunately, we cannot be any more specific as to its origins until there is a larger genetic database.<span id="isPasted" style='color: rgb(31, 31, 31); font-family: "Google Sans", Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;'></span><br/></p>
