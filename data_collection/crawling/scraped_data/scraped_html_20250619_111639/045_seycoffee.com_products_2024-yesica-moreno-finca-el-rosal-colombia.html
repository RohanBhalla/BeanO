She was traveling with Alejandro Renjifo and his exporting company Fairfield Trading in order to share insights and techniques to producers in the region. She is highly ambitious, and is constantly learning and improving year after year. Her main goals are to continue improving the quality of her coffee while minimizing negative environmental impact. She is especially interested in sustainable farming practices using little or no chemical inputs, and improving soil health through the planting of native plants and trees. She has also started teaching her neighboring producers how to improve their quality and avail themselves to the specialty market. Her contribution to specialty coffee within the region of Gaitania cannot be overstated, and it is a true honor to work with her coffee."}' style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;color:#000000;"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

She is a young, second-generation coffee producer. Since inheriting her small 2.5-hectare (~6 acres) farm, she has turned it into a family-run business. Her husband oversees land management and hand-picking laborers while she does all of the processing and drying. Her eldest son also helps her with the processing and hopes to become more involved. This is only the beginning Chiroso season from Urrao, an unbelievably special place that produces magical coffees.</p><h2><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->ABOUT CHIROSO</h2><p>Chiroso is a new variety being grown primarily in the region of Antioquia, Colombia. We only started hearing about its cultivation a couple of years ago, but because of its cup quality potential it is beginning to spread. The variety has been genetically identified as an Ethiopian Landrace, but unfortunately we cannot get any more specific than that at this time. We have been working very hard building a buying program in the region of Urrao specifically around the variety of Chiroso. We still don't know where or how this variety came to be cultivated in this particular region, but its cup quality is extraordinary. We will be working with our exporting partner, The Coffee Quest, to continue developing this project, and hope that we'll be able to bring you more of this special coffee from this special region year after year.<span id="isPasted" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(0, 255, 0); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"></span><span id="isPasted" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(0, 255, 0); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"></span><span id="isPasted" style='color: rgb(31, 31, 31); font-family: "Google Sans", Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;'></span><br/></p>

<p>The cost of getting a coffee from cherry to beverage varies enormously depending on its place of origin and the location of its consumption. The inclusion of price transparency is a starting point to inform broader conversation around the true costs of production and the sustainability of specialty coffee as a whole.</p>
