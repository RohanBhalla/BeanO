She was traveling with Alejandro Renjifo and his exporting company Fairfield Trading in order to share insights and techniques to producers in the region. She is highly ambitious, and is constantly learning and improving year after year. Her main goals are to continue improving the quality of her coffee while minimizing negative environmental impact. She is especially interested in sustainable farming practices using little or no chemical inputs, and improving soil health through the planting of native plants and trees. She has also started teaching her neighboring producers how to improve their quality and avail themselves to the specialty market.

Copa de Oro is highly successful in bringing roasters and buyers together to taste coffees from previously unknown producers. More importantly, it exposes producers to international markets, which is extremely difficult for producers to do independently. We want to extend our gratitude to our friends at Osito for all the hard work that went into putting on this impressive competition, and to all of the producers who worked extremely hard to produce the extraordinary coffees we tasted there. We look forward to supporting this competition for many years to come!</p><h2><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->ABOUT PINK BOURBON</h2><p>Pink Bourbon is a relatively new variety being grown primarily in and around Huila, Colombia.

<p>The cost of getting a coffee from cherry to beverage varies enormously depending on its place of origin and the location of its consumption. The inclusion of price transparency is a starting point to inform broader conversation around the true costs of production and the sustainability of specialty coffee as a whole.</p>
